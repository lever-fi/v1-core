# Lever Pools - v1 Core

Core smart contracts (v1) for the Lever Pools product.
Lever Pools by Lever Finance - Enabling loan-based purchasing of NFTs.
Simply put, this isn't another p2p lending protocol where someone lends their NFT and someone else borrows it.
We are a fully on-chain BNPL protocol. If you don't want to spend 100 ETH on an NFT, we'll help you finance the purchase - just pay back with interest.

# Lever Finance

Lever Finance is an ecosystem of decentralized, autonomous protocols empowering NFT DeFi.
We're building the infrastructure for the NFT DeFi ecosystem.
